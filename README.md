### Creating Plugins

Visual Code Space supports custom plugins written in BeanShell. To create a plugin:

1. **Create the Plugin Directory**:
    - Create a plugin through the application settings. The plugin directory will be located at `/storage/emulated/0/VCSpace/plugins/<your-plugin-package>`.

2. **Modify the Entry Point (Optional)**:
    - To use a different function as the entry point, update the `entryPoint` field in the `manifest.json` file to the name of the desired function. For instance, if you want `startPlugin` as the entry point, set `entryPoint` to `"startPlugin"` in the manifest.

3. **Run the Plugin**:
    - Once the plugin is configured, the Visual Code Space app will automatically load and execute the plugin when the application starts.

For detailed instructions and examples, refer to the [Create a Plugin](docs/create_plugin.md) documentation.
